Hand and Body gestures are super cool to use instead of keyboard keys specially in case of games so I have made a project in which I have used my hands and body gestures to control the Subway Surfer game.
# Controls
One can easily control this game with the help of hand and body gestures, the controls for the game are as follows-
Start- Raise two fingers of both hands
Right- I have given a green mark in the centre to divide frame, to move right you need to move to the right of green mark.
Left- Move to the left of green mark.
Up- Make a nice jump for smooth execution.
Down- Move down in a postion similar to doing squats, this will also make you to do exercise, one roll down of character will be equal to your one squat.
# Links
Link for the game website- https://www.kiloo.com/subway-surfers/
With the help of the above link and the python code one can easily play the game, but if still one faces the problem I have created a youtube video which will help to learn how to play it and will also help in understanding the controls.
